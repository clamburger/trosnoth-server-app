## What is Trosnoth? ##
Trosnoth is a 2D sidescroller that rewards strategy and teamwork. To win the game, you have to capture every zone. If you don't know what Trosnoth is, it's unlikely you'll get much use out of this application: check out the [Trosnoth website](http://trosnoth.org) for more information.

## What does this application do? ##
Most Trosnoth games run off a authentication server. This application is designed to provide a clean, simple interface for administering this server (the only other alternative is using Telnet).

## Current Version ##
The application is still in very early stages, so it doesn't have a version as such. Consider it to be pre-alpha.

## Requirements ##
  * This app requires **Android 2.3.3** (SDK 10) or above. It could potentially work on lower versions, however this has not been tested.
